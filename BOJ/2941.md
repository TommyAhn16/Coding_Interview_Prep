## Solution

- Use two pointers to keep track of word under inspection

```python
whole = {"c=","c-","dz=","d-","lj","nj","s=","z="}
s = list(input())
if len(s) == 1:
  print(1)
else:
  i = 0
  j = 1
  count = 0
  while i < len(s) and j < len(s):
    if s[i]+s[j] in whole:
      count += 1
      i += 2
      j += 2
    elif s[i]+s[j] == "dz" and j < len(s)-1:
      if s[i]+s[j]+s[j+1] == "dz=":
        count += 1
        i += 3
        j += 3
      else:
        count += 1
        i += 1
        j += 1
    else:
      count += 1
      i += 1
      j += 1
    if i < len(s) and j >= len(s):
      count += 1
      break
  print(count)
```
